   <h1>world wide web</h1>
   <p>This article is about the global system of pages accessed via HTTP. For the worldwide computer network, see Internet. For the web browser<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.</p>
   <p>he Web was invented by English computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991.It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[3][4] Documents and other media content are made available to the network through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">sever</a> can be accessed by programs such as web browsers.</p>
   <p> Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">uniform resource locators.</a> The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction.</p> 
   <p>The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</a></p>
